description: Edit and author 3D models for a Decentraland scene through the Blender MCP — setup and connection of the MCP itself, low-poly modeling, PBR materials, palette textures, collider meshes, and GLB export back into the scene. Use whenever the user mentions creating a new custom model or editing/retexturing/optimizing an existing scene model (offer the Blender MCP and set it up if needed), or whenever an `mcp__blender__*` tool is available and the task touches 3D models. Do NOT use for placing/positioning models in the scene (see add-3d-models) or SDK material components (see advanced-rendering).

# Editing Scene Models with the Blender MCP

Drive a running Blender instance through its MCP server to create and edit the GLB models of a Decentraland scene: import a model from the scene's asset folders, edit it, and export it back to the same path — the scene preview hot-reloads the file on save.

The connected `mcp__blender__*` tools are self-describing — each carries its name, arguments, and output shape. Treat that as the authoritative tool catalog. The official Blender MCP server ([blender.org/lab/mcp-server](https://www.blender.org/lab/mcp-server/)) exposes inspection tools (`get_objects_summary`, `get_object_detail_summary`, `get_screenshot_of_window_as_image`, `render_viewport_to_path`), bundled documentation search (`search_api_docs`, `search_manual_docs`, `get_python_api_docs`), and a Python executor (`execute_blender_code`) that runs arbitrary `bpy` code — the bulk of real work happens through `bpy`. Two distinct Blender MCPs are in circulation — read the session's tool names to tell which one is connected, since `execute_blender_code` exists on both: `get_objects_summary` / `get_object_detail_summary` / `search_api_docs` mean the **official Blender Lab** server ([projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp](https://projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp), Blender 5.1+, add-on id `mcp` — the one Setup below installs); `get_scene_info` / `get_viewport_screenshot` plus Polyhaven/Sketchfab/Hyper3D asset tools mean the **community** server ([ahujasid/blender-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp), Blender 3.0+, add-on "Blender MCP"). Everything in this skill applies to both. Ready-made `bpy` snippets for the patterns below live in [`references/blender-patterns.md`](references/blender-patterns.md).

## Intent gate — offer Blender, don't assume

When the user asks to **create a new model** or **edit an existing scene model**, ask whether they want to do it through the Blender MCP before running any setup step: *"Do you want me to create/edit this model in Blender via the Blender MCP? I can set it up if it's not configured yet."* Ask, call no setup tool, and let the user answer.

- **YES** — run Setup below (skip it if `mcp__blender__*` tools already answered earlier this session).
- **NO** — use no Blender step. Cover the need another way: free catalog models (**add-3d-models**), SDK primitives with `MeshRenderer`, or hand the user modeling guidance. Never simulate Blender edits by hand-writing GLB binary data.

Running as a subagent, you cannot open this gate — there is no user to ask. Stop and report the pending decision to your caller with your recommendation instead of proceeding on your own authority.

## RULE: Never fall back silently to headless Blender

Blender can be driven without the MCP (`Blender --background --python script.py`), and that is sometimes the right call — but it is the **user's** call, never yours. When the Blender MCP is unavailable in the session (no `mcp__blender__*` tools, or the MCP was registered only after session start), do NOT quietly substitute headless/CLI Blender, a Python glTF library, or any other mechanism. Substituting silently hides a broken setup and leaves the user believing the MCP did the work.

Stop and put the choice to the user:

> The Blender MCP isn't available in this session. Two options: (a) set it up / register it — the session has to restart before its tools bind, or (b) I drive Blender headless via the CLI (`--background --python`) as a deliberate fallback, where verification is limited to rendered images written to disk instead of live viewport screenshots. Which do you want?

Wait for the answer. **(a)** → Setup below. **(b)** → proceed with the CLI, and say in your first message that you are on the fallback path; every other RULE in this skill still applies.

Running as a subagent, report this pending decision to your caller with your recommendation, exactly as with the intent gate above. Never choose the fallback on your own authority.

## Setup (once per session)

The Blender MCP has three parts, and all three must be alive for tools to work ([source + docs](https://projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp)):

```
MCP client (this agent) ⇐ MCP/stdio ⇒ blender-mcp (Python process) ⇐ TCP localhost:9876 ⇒ MCP add-on inside Blender
```

> **Security note (from the official docs):** the MCP server executes generated Python in Blender with no guards. Keep edits scoped to the scene's model files, and don't touch unrelated .blend data.

1. **Probe.** If `mcp__blender__*` tools are available in the session, call a cheap read-only one (`get_objects_summary` or equivalent):
   - **Answers** → everything is running; skip to the workflow.
   - **Connection error** → the client side is configured but Blender's side is down: Blender isn't running, the add-on is missing/disabled, or its bridge server isn't started. Go to step 3.

   If no `mcp__blender__*` tools exist in the session, the MCP was never configured (or was registered after session start — registration only binds on a new session). Do **not** read this as a cue to drive Blender headless: open the headless-fallback choice above first, and continue with step 2 only if the user picks setup.

2. **Install and register (first time only).** Confirm each requirement with the user rather than assuming:
   - **Blender 5.1 or newer.** The MCP add-on's manifest requires `blender_version_min = 5.1.0` — it will not install on older Blender. Check with `blender --version` or ask; if too old, the user must update via [blender.org/download](https://www.blender.org/download/).
   - **The MCP add-on** (id `mcp`, by Blender Lab). From [blender.org/lab/mcp-server](https://www.blender.org/lab/mcp-server/), drag the **"Drag and Drop into Blender"** button into a Blender window — **twice**: the first drop adds the Blender Lab extension repository (`lab.blender.org`), the second installs the add-on. Alternatively download the zip and use Preferences → Get Extensions → **Install from Disk** ([manual](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/extensions.html#install)).
   - **Allow Online Access** must be enabled (Preferences → System → Network) — the add-on refuses to start its bridge without it and reports *"Online access must be enabled in the system preferences"*.
   - **The MCP server package**, cloned locally (needs `git` and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Python ≥ 3.10):

     ```bash
     cd $HOME && git clone https://projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp.git
     ```

   - **Register with the MCP client.** For Claude Code:

     ```bash
     claude mcp add --scope user blender -- uv --directory $HOME/blender_mcp/mcp run blender-mcp
     ```

     For other clients, the equivalent config-file entry ([setup wiki](https://projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp/wiki/Setup); replace `$HOME` with an absolute path if the client doesn't expand variables):

     ```json
     { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "uv", "args": ["--directory", "$HOME/blender_mcp/mcp", "run", "blender-mcp"] } } }
     ```

     Clients that support MCP bundles (e.g. Claude Desktop) can instead install the `.mcpb` package from the [releases page](https://projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp/releases).

   - **Registration is not binding.** MCP tools load at session start, so after registering, the user must restart the session/agent for `mcp__blender__*` tools to appear. Say so explicitly and stop here until they do.

3. **Start Blender's side.** Have the user launch Blender (5.1+). The add-on's bridge server **auto-starts by default** a few seconds after launch; if tools still can't connect, check Preferences → Add-ons → **MCP**: any startup error is shown there, and a **Start/Stop** button plus Host/Port settings (default `localhost:9876`) let them start it manually. Then re-probe (step 1).

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add-on won't install / not listed in Get Extensions | Blender older than 5.1 | Update Blender ([blender.org/download](https://www.blender.org/download/)) |
| Add-on error: "Online access must be enabled…" | Blender's online access is off | Preferences → System → Network → **Allow Online Access** |
| `mcp__blender__*` tools absent from session | MCP never registered, or registered mid-session | Offer the headless-fallback choice, then step 2; restart the session after registering — never switch to CLI Blender unasked |
| Tools exist but every call fails to connect | Blender closed, add-on disabled, or bridge not started | Step 3 — check the add-on's preferences panel for the startup error |
| `uv: command not found` when the client launches the server | `uv` not installed | Install per [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) |
| Server can't reach Blender on a custom port | Add-on port changed but server still on 9876 | Match them: add-on prefs Host/Port vs `BLENDER_MCP_HOST`/`BLENDER_MCP_PORT` env vars on the server |
| Client config with `$HOME` fails | Client doesn't expand variables | Use the absolute path |

For anything deeper, point the user to the official docs: [blender.org/lab/mcp-server](https://www.blender.org/lab/mcp-server/) and the [project wiki](https://projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp/wiki/Setup).

## Workflow: round-trip through the scene folder

1. **Start clean — but never wipe the user's work.** First inspect what's open (`get_objects_summary`). If it's Blender's default startup scene (cube, light, camera), delete those objects and proceed. If the user has their own file open with unsaved content, ask before touching it — work in a new empty scene/file instead of deleting their objects.
2. **Import the model from the scene's asset folder** (`assets/Models/`, or wherever the scene keeps it — check first, see the asset folder conventions in **add-3d-models**): `bpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath=...)`.
3. **Edit**, verifying visually with a screenshot tool (`get_screenshot_of_window_as_image` or the server's equivalent) after significant steps.
4. **Run the pre-export checklist** (below), then **export back to the same path** as binary `.glb`. The dev server hot-reloads the file — no restart needed.
5. **Re-audit placement if the bounding box or pivot changed.** The entity's `Transform` was tuned for the old geometry; follow the model-swap audit in **add-3d-models** (native bounding box → scale → pivot → world-space bounds vs. scene limits).
6. **Keep working files out of the deploy.** If you save a `.blend` alongside the scene, add it to `.dclignore` (see **deploy-scene**) — source files are often the bulk of a project's size and are never needed at runtime.

## RULE: Keep models low-poly

Decentraland's triangle budget is **10,000 triangles per parcel** for the whole scene (see **optimize-scene** for all limits). Budget per model:

| Model role       | Triangles     |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Small props      | 100–500       |
| Medium objects   | 500–1,500     |
| Large buildings  | 1,500–5,000   |
| Hero pieces      | up to 10,000  |

- Model low-poly from the start; don't sculpt high and decimate as a routine (decimation is a rescue tool for imported models, not a workflow).
- Never leave Subdivision Surface, Multires, or dense Bevel modifiers on at export — if a modifier is doing visual work, keep its level low and remember `export_apply=True` bakes it into the exported mesh.
- Delete faces the player can never see (undersides, occluded backs of wall-mounted props); enable back-face culling instead of doubling geometry.
- **Count triangles before every export** (evaluated mesh, modifiers included — script in the references file) and report the number. Compare against the scene's remaining budget, not just the per-model guideline.

## RULE: All materials must be PBR (Principled BSDF)

The engine renders glTF **metallic-roughness PBR** materials only, and Blender's glTF exporter can only translate node setups built around a single **Principled BSDF** into that format. Anything else — Diffuse/Glossy/Mix shader graphs, procedural textures (Noise, Voronoi, gradients), texture nodes routed through color ramps — exports wrong or gets silently dropped.

- Every material: one Principled BSDF into the Material Output. Base Color, Metallic, Roughness, Normal, Emission, and Alpha translate cleanly.
- Procedural shading must be **baked to image textures** before export.
- Textures must be power-of-two and **at most 1024×1024** — the asset-bundle converter downscales anything larger, so authoring above 1024 wastes file size (see **optimize-scene**).
- Emissive surfaces: set Emission Color + Emission Strength on the Principled BSDF — this renders as expected in the engine.

## RULE: No lights or cameras in the export

The engine does not read lights or cameras from GLB files — they add file size and clutter for zero effect. Scene lighting is done through the SDK instead (see **lighting-environment**).

- Delete all light and camera objects before export (the default startup scene has one of each).
- Belt-and-braces: export with `export_cameras=False` and `export_lights=False`.
- If the user asks to "light the model" in Blender, explain that lighting must be done in the SDK and point them to **lighting-environment**; Blender lights only affect Blender's own viewport.

## RULE: Unify plain colors into one palette texture

Materials are one of the scarcest scene resources (**20 materials for a 1-parcel scene**, growing only logarithmically — see **optimize-scene**), and every extra material is an extra draw call. When a model (or a set of models) uses flat colors, do NOT create one material per color:

- Build a **single small palette texture** (e.g. 64×64 with a grid of color swatches), one material with that texture as Base Color, and UV-map each face to the center of its swatch. Use `Closest` interpolation so swatch edges don't bleed.
- **Share the same palette across all the scene's plain-colored models** — same texture file = one material and one texture engine-side.
- Adding a color later means filling an unused swatch, not adding a material.
- Full `bpy` scripts (build the palette image, assign faces to swatches) are in [`references/blender-patterns.md`](references/blender-patterns.md).

The same logic applies beyond plain colors: prefer one texture atlas over many small per-part textures.

## RULE: No materials on collider meshes

Collider meshes (name ending in `_collider`) are never rendered — the engine strips them to physics geometry. A material on a collider mesh still counts against the scene's material limit and bloats the file for zero visual effect.

- Clear all material slots on every `_collider` mesh before export (`obj.data.materials.clear()`).
- Keep colliders ultra-low-poly: boxes, planes, or convex hulls approximating the visible shape — never a copy of the detailed mesh.
- Name them `<meshName>_collider` and keep them in the export; the entity then needs `visibleMeshesCollisionMask: 0, invisibleMeshesCollisionMask: 3` on its `GltfContainer` (see **add-3d-models** for the mask patterns).
- Simple props often don't need a collider mesh at all — colliding on the visible mesh (`visibleMeshesCollisionMask: 3`) is fine when the visible mesh is already low-poly.

## RULE: Stay within scene limits

Before exporting, check what the model adds against the scene's budget (formulas and full table in **optimize-scene**; `n` = parcel count):

- **Triangles**: `n × 10,000` scene-wide — count the evaluated mesh before export.
- **Materials**: `log2(n+1) × 20` scene-wide — merge, use the palette pattern, reuse textures across models.
- **Textures**: `log2(n+1) × 10` scene-wide — power-of-two, ≤1024×1024.
- **File size**: 15 MB per parcel, 50 MB max per file — keep GLBs well under this; textures are usually the culprit.
- **Height**: `log2(n+1) × 20` m — a tall model can break the height limit even when its origin sits at y=0.

These are soft limits (except file size) — exceeding them hurts performance but does not block publishing. When a model pushes the scene over, say so and propose reductions rather than silently exporting.

## Pre-export checklist

Run through this before every export (scripts for each check in [`references/blender-patterns.md`](references/blender-patterns.md)):

1. Triangle count verified against budget.
2. All materials are Principled BSDF; procedural shading baked; textures ≤1024 power-of-two.
3. Plain colors unified into a palette texture, not per-color materials.
4. No lights, no cameras.
5. Collider meshes named `*_collider`, no material slots, low-poly.
6. Origin at **bottom-center** of the model so `Transform.position.y = 0` grounds it; rotation/scale applied (`transform_apply`).
7. Export as binary `.glb`, **+Y up** (exporter default — Decentraland is Y-up; a Z-up export loads tipped over), `export_apply=True`, `export_cameras=False`, `export_lights=False`, and `export_animation_mode='ACTIVE_ACTIONS'` if the file contains animations (the default mode leaks every action in the .blend into the GLB).
